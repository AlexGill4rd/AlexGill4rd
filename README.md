  I'm Alex, 18 years old software engineer. Big passion for programming and I see myself doing this for a long time. I love writing code, trying out new stuff and saving   time by automating boring tasks. It's even more fun when working with a team.

<h2 align="center">Why coding do you ask?</h2>
<p align="center">
  Wonder why i love to program? I love to program because it is pure creation; of fun, joy and 100% creativity. I like creating tools that save me time, but also others. I like creating software for computers, but most of all like creating new inovating fullstack websites in my free time to learn more and more.

  Sitting at a desk, staring into an illuminated computer screen for hours, a programmer's life doesn't seem to have much variety or glamor. Working in software has at times broken my heart and bruised my soul; but for one reason or another I haven't ever been able to give it up. Software development is by far the most technically challenging and intellectually stimulating work I've ever found. The fact that there remains so much to be discovered, with such massive potential returns on each new discovery, makes me optimistic that all the last projects will not be the last, or at least not anytime soon.
